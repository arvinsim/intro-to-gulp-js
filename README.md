##Introduction to Build Systems
###What are Build Systems?
    - Systems used to automate common tasks
        - run automated tests
        - check for code standards like JSHINT for javascript
        - deployment to production systems
        - creating documentation and/or release notes
        - for web development, it includes tasks like
            - minifying adn combining javascript
            - compilatiion of LESS/SASS files
        - for desktop applications
            - compiling computer source code into binary code
    -  a lazy programmer is a good programmer
        - Larry Wall(http://threevirtues.com/)
            - Laziness: The quality of that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes
                you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't
                have to answer so many questions about it.

Guys and Gals, Good Morning

First let me introduce myself. My name is Arthur Vincent Simon. I am a web developer working with Innovuze. Our office is located at the Gateway Tower,8th floor...(After 20 seconds of introduction, show GIF "Ain't nobody got time for that"). Oo na lagi.

So let us get in with the juice. What am I discussing today? What is in for you? Let me give you a summary of what to expect. In case, you find the topics boring, the door is
always open and no, no one will shame you in doing so. But I am pretty sure that no one do that kay mag ninja moves raman mo kung boringan mo so on to the summary

- Build Systems
    - What are they?
    - Why are they relevant in the programming world.
    - In what way can they be useful for me, a student? a developer?

First, we need to talk about the concepts. If you can just understand the concept, the implementation will then handle itself. If you get what build systems mean even if you 
didn't get gulp.js part, then my mission is still accomplished.

Ok, let's talk about build systems. Let's see what Wikipedia has to say about it

"
    Build automation is the act of scripting or automating a wide variety of tasks that software developers do in their day-to-day activities including things like:

    - compiling computer source code into binary code
    - packaging binary code
    - running automated tests
    - deploying to production systems
    - creating documentation and/or release notes
"

In short, TAPOLAN ang mga software developers. Not that it is a bad thing though given the proper context. Yup. I am serious. To quote Larry Wall, the creator of the Perl programming language, "a lazy programmer is a good programmer". He has this 3 "virtues" of a programmer(http://threevirtues.com/). The first one is Laziness

            - Laziness: The quality of that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes
                you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't
                have to answer so many questions about it.
"

But joking aside, people who are in the desktop application side of things, where they had to build binaries(exes in windows) are already familiar with this things. It is practically required for them.

As opposed to people in Web Development, who I would assumed, mostly started with a plug-in-play approach. Simply put a HTML or PHP file in a the web server and that's it. You already have a webpage. Screw that, we only even just need to open an HTML file in a browser and we are already showing a webpage.

I think the Web Development world slowly adopted it. At the risk of disclosing my age, I can't remember being acquainted with any build systems before when I was in college. Frameworks, libraries and plugins...yes but build systems? Zilch. Nada. Zero.


We will sidetrack a bit to talk about NodeJS since gulp.js needs it to run

- A VERY brief introduction to NodeJS
    - What is NodeJS and how is it related to gulp.js

Then we will go on to the actual software and implementations

- Introduction to gulp.js
    - What is gulp.js?
    - Why use gulp.js?

- gulp.js Basics
    - Installation
    - A Simple Example - Minifying Javascript(Uglify)
    - gulp.js API and their parameters

- More gulp.js
    - commandline parameters
    - Very common plugins

- More advanced examples
    - Browserify
    - LESS
    - JSHint and JSDOC
    - BrowserSync
    - Image Optimization
